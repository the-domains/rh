<p>It might look like I'm just posing, and you may be right, but the reality also is that I hadn't been happy with my life since I left university. </p><p>Having completed a degree in psychology I proceeded to make a series of bad career choices and spent the next 6 years aimlessly job hopping and continuously believing one day I would have a big entrepreneurial break. I read a book and quit my job. In my head it was as simple as that. </p><p>Yea right! I became lazy,  lacked direction and ultimately battled with depression, feeling like I couldn't do anything and was worthless. In all honesty, I still fight those demons to this day. But I did some serious thinking over the Christmas period and somehow started rewiring my brain to remember that I do have a personal portfolio that is worth something. </p><p>How this came about is interesting and something I wanted to explore in more depth in an attempt to deconstruct where I went wrong and how to move forward more positively. </p><p>Allow me to take you back a few years further. I was about 5 and started to play tennis. Having taken my first few steps on a squash court due to my parents living above a squash club in my early years, I had grown up around racquet sports. I quickly became very good and competed on a pretty high level. I didn't love it enough to push myself beyond a certain standard, but in the end it was irrelevant since I had to quit due to an ongoing injury problem. I was 16 by this point. </p><p>One thing I had always loved was football (or soccer - queue UK/US relations break down). There was only one problem... I was terrible at it. Literally awful. I started trying to get into the middle school teams at try outs and for 2 consecutive years (I was 14 at this point) I didn't get picked. </p><p>But I was determined to play, so I practiced for hours and I ran and I ran and I ran. My effort was undeniable. My skill still left a lot to be desired for. Going into high school, I finally got picked to play for junior varsity. I had reached the first major milestone in my football 'career'. It is worth mentioning at this point that I was still terrible. Over enthusiastic, no comprehension of the game and not a single ounce of shooting power in my scrawny (but nimble) legs. </p><p>My final year came and I was finally picked to play for varsity.  Perhaps not for reasons I should be proud of, considering I was predominantly used as the last bastion of defence in a sweeper position. Again, my skill wasn't great so I called upon my endless tank of energy, channeled aggression and disregard for my body to become the most effective, not so elegant battering ram. </p><p>If you are bored by now because you don't like football or understand what a sweeper is, please bare with me. It will come together.</p><p>Academically I was a lost cause. Parent teacher conferences consisted of a barrage of teacher clichés - 'He has so much potential, if only he applied himself properly.' I wanted to study psychology, but my university councillor urged me to be realistic. My grades were shocking. Sure enough I studied sports, where I was introduced to sports psychology and reconfirmed my desire to study psychology. Upon 'applying' myself, my sport psychology lecturer saw that I had the capability to be on a course, which my grades said I didn't. I received a glowing recommendation and swiftly changed campus the next year to study what I loved. </p><p>I enjoyed it so much, that I rarely needed to turn up to class. I read voraciously and focused on playing football and making the most out of the social life university offers you. My final year consisted of me attending one half of a lecture, but also winning the intramural university football league with my team. Over the 3 years I had become a better player. I started studying goal scorers and modelling their movements. In NLP this would be considered mirroring. My left foot became powerful and more accurate. I went from non-technical defensive battering ram to goal-scoring striker/winger. </p><p>Having left university and having started to work I played less competitively, but always kept myself honing my passion on the pitch. I stupidly took a managerial role in a horrible retail brand and swiftly became disillusioned. This is where the next journey began. After a year of listening to people talk about fashion as if they were heart surgeons, I quit and decided to give this whole entrepreneur thing a shot. I didn't have the balls, or the right attitude to do it. Depression ensued. I took a landscape gardening job and worked in a gym to make a bit of cash, but I was unfulfilled. </p><p>On the pitch however, things got even better. I joined a team that actually paid me to play. I had finally reached what was, for me, the holy grail. It was just about enough to pay for my petrol to training and a good night out after the match, but nevertheless... the unwanted middle school footballer I once was, became an effective and dangerous player.</p><p>Now this is where things get interesting (I know, it took a while... My bad).  I had fought and worked so hard to get there. Every minute in training I took with 100% focus and dedication. Every second in the game I worked tirelessly for my team and for the victory. Sometimes we won and sometimes we lost. I analysed both situations and knew there was room for improvement. After a loss, I would be furious, but I learnt and picked myself up for the next game. More determined, more vicious. </p><p>But for some reason, in life and with my other aspirations I had given up the fight. I had no more drive. </p><p>Football kept me alive and the rest of life became a big puzzle to me. What was I missing? Why couldn't I apply the same energy and belief to what I really wanted? Freedom of time and money. Creating a business that might potentially change lives.</p><p>I spent the next few years taking various jobs, continuously thinking about the dream of my own business. Resenting every minute I spent in an office. </p><p>And here we are now. I started a small mobile app business a few months ago but didn't have full belief in myself yet again. I was at another drastic low-point. Medicating every night questioning myself... yet again. What am I not getting? I have tried the whole meditation, habit building, staying fit. Investing in myself. Nothing has worked. </p><p>Upon deeper analysis pretty much everything has stemmed from an enormous fear of failure. Procrastination, inconsistency, overwhelm, anxiety you name it. It can all be traced back to that. </p><p>So I started to ask myself - How could I perform so effectively in my athletic endeavours, but not translate that to my desires to be an entrepreneur?</p><p>I believe everything in life connects. I am good at connecting the dots, I can figure this one out. Life and business is essentially a big game. You put in work on the training ground and put it into practice on match day. You go in knowing a win is necessary, but when you lose you know there is always the next game, the next season. You pick yourself up without worry. Without fear of being inadequate. Sure you might lose confidence and have a rough patch, but it's all cyclical and with the right mindset you can come out of it stronger and better. </p><p>In coming to this conclusion I decided before Christmas to enrol myself in a start up programme and in an attempt to get my fight back, I will also train from this day on to get in the ring for cancer research. In April I will be boxing, not only to raise money for a noble cause, but also to get my fight back and no longer live with what ifs but treat every day like it's game time. </p><p>This is the journey. This is finding my fight. </p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="24"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="25"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="26"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="27"><span data-reactid="28"><!-- react-empty: 29 --><h2 data-reactid="30"><a data-reactid="31">rh</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="32"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="34"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="35"></div></section></div></div>
